Two endpoints have been realized in the application.
1. Endpoint 'code' accepts a zip code and returns geographical coordinates
2. Endpoint 'swap' accepts a question and returns an answer for this question 
based on the Api.ai
3. All pairs 'question-answer' are being saved in the file named date of the 
request
